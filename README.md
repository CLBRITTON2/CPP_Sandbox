# CPP Sandbox
<div>This is essentially a note taking/experimental repository for organizing material as I continue to learn C++</div>
<div>Each topic (ex: pointers) will have subdirectories for concepts that fall under the topic</div>
<div>These sub directories will mostly consist of a single executable with a make file - this may change if single files start getting messy</div>
